# Integrative multi-omics and multivariate longitudinal data analysis for dynamic prediction in Alzheimerâ€™s disease
The repository contains the simulation example codes of the aforementioned proposed method.

To run the simulation, please locate simulation/R_code/: 

(1) Run true_parameters.R to generate RData

(2) Run create_Z.R files to generate data in each setting.

(3) Run simulation.R files to run the model.
